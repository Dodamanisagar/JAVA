public class AboutCollectionInterface {
    /**CollectionInterface:-
     --->Collection is a predefined interface present in java.util package. It has several classes and interface to represent group of Objects as a single entity.
     --->It is introduced from JDK 1.2
     --->Collection is used to store the group of objects as a single entity.
     --->Collection interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any Collection objects.
     --->In general Collection Interface is considered as root Interface of Collection framework.
     --->There is no concrete class which implement collection interface directly.
     --->Like Object class, collection interface is a super most interface in collection hierarchy.

     *Difference between Collection and Array:-
     * Array:-
     --->Array is Homogeneous in nature.
     --->Fixed size, that's why we must know the size before using.
     --->No predefined Methods present in array.
     --->Doesn't support Generics.
     --->Underlined data structured is not present.
     --->Can hold both primitive and Objects types.

     *Collection:-
     --->It is both homogeneous and heterogeneous in nature.
     --->Dynamic in size, so size is not mandatory to know before use.
     --->Many predefined methods are presents.
     --->Support Generics.
     --->Underlined data structured are present.
     --->Can hold Objects types only.


     *Important methods present in Collection interface:-
     1)add()
     2)addAll()
     3)contains()
     4)containsAll()
     5)remove()
     6)removeAll()
     7)size()
     8)clear()
     9)isEmpty()
     10)iterator()...etc


     *Wrapper Class:-
     --->The non-primitive version of a primitive dataType is called as wrapper class.
     --->All Wrapper classes are present in java.lang package.
     --->toString() is Overridden in all wrapper classes, String class and Collection.
     NOTE:-Collection framework doesn't support primitive datatype therefore the alternate use is called "Wrapper class".

     Primitive-DataTypes                Non-Primitive Datattpes
     1)byte                      -->    Byte
     2)short                     -->    Short
     3)int                       -->    Integer
     4)long                      -->    Long
     5)float                     -->    Float
     6)double                    -->    Double
     7)char                      -->    Character
     8)boolean                   -->    Boolean

     *Auto-Boxing:-
     --->The process of converting primitive datatype into non-primitive data type is called Auto Boxing.

     *Auto Un-Boxing:-
     --->The process of converting non-primitive datatype into primitive data type is called Auto Boxing.

     *Generics:-
     --->Generics is used to specify the element type of collection.
     --->Generics was introduced from JDK 1.2
     SYNTAX:-<element type>
